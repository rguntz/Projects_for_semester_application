This GitHub repository contains two personal projects that I have completed on my own.

The first project, titled "Tavli_algo," is an algorithm that determines the best possible move for a given position in a backgammon game 
(originally developed for the Greek version called Tavli). The algorithm uses Monte Carlo Tree Simulation to find the optimal move. 
This type of algorithm is commonly used in backgammon solutions.

The second project, "Greyhound Racing," contains the code used to predict the results of a greyhound race. 
The main task involved creating useful performance parameters that would later be used in the machine learning process. 
These parameters include the average time of previous races (all or just the last five), progression coefficients, 
the mean positions of the dog, the Markov chain of position changes between races, and more. Only the code for the machine learning 
process is included in the folder; the code that generates the parameters is not displayed.
